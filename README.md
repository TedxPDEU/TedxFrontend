# TEDxPDEU Website

TEDxPDEU is an independently organised community facing TEDX event. This is the third iteration of the event, the first two being in 2018 and 2019. Our theme for TEDxPDEU 2022 is 'Charting the Uncharted'.

This theme is important right now more than ever seeing as the number of global changes and challenges that we are amidst have led to the advent in various niches that were previously thought to be impossible. We will have speakers coming to speak for this event from various walks of life there to elucidate and speak in bite-sized 18 minute slots about their fields of expertise and experience.
